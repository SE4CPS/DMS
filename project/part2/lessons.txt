- Decryption can take up to 30 seconds longer from 1 second without decryption
- It is very easy to make a query slow, particularly if a lot of data is returned
- The location of the database matters for network latency
- Indexing makes SELECT queries much faster (noticeable around 10k rows)
- Perform long-term performance testing early and add LIMIT constraints early
- Validate data as early as possible (data type and data range) 
- Remove ORDER BY; ENCRYPTION; ADD LIMIT makes query much faster
- COMMUNICATION IS OFTEN THE BOTTLENECK
- Admin tool to upload data
